## Note to v1 users
 - I removed some functions such as configure r18 settings and dimension options for search, this is because in order to solve the login issue, I had to use an Android login entry point which does not support as much functionalities as the web logged user does. So in order to provide a consistent interface, I decided to remove them. Although I had found a way to solve the login issue of web, but it require a lot time to implement the technique and it requires a extra dependency, I am still a student and need to study ... I will try to fix them in the future when I am free, no guarantee though ...
 - Instead of using string as parameters now I created params.py which contains enums covering almost all input parameters
 - A brand new download printing is introduced for better ux, instead of popping out skips in the process, they will pop out together at the end, and now it has a est. time left
